/**
 * <p>Represents a database using Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC). A MVCC
 * database consists of a tree which can be split up into several branches.
 * Each branch consists of several commits which contain references to
 * database objects. The MVCC database provides quick access to single objects.
 * How this is achieved, is implementation-specific.</p>
 * <p>The following abbreviations are used throughout the framework:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>CID</dt><dd>Commit ID (unique for each commit in the tree)</dd>
 * <dt>UID</dt><dd>The application-specific unique key for each database
 * object. This ID is independent from the various versions of the object, it
 * exists throughout the whole lifetime of an object, regardless which
 * representation it currently has. Objects added to the database will
 * automatically be assigned a new ID.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p><strong>Thread-safety:</strong> this class is thread-safe.</p>
